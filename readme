Hi! this project is a preview of a page for a company, in this case the page is in spanish. 
The project is made on Spring Boot for the Backend, and ReactJS with tailwindCSS for the Frontend.

The site has these views:
  -home : "/"
  -list (list of posts) : "/listado/fecha-reciente/0/&text=&category="
  -contact "/contacto"
  -detail (detail of post) "/detalles/{id}"
  -createPost : "/propiedad/crear"
  -createCategory : "/categoria/crear"
  
 In the backend we have a DDBB with all the posts and categories with a simple ManyToMany relationship between tables.
 
 Pending: create the Security methods with Spring Security (JWT token AUTH and ADMIN, USER roles).
